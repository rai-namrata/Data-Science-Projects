# Data Science Projects

This repository is a series of projects I have worked on as I continue to learn and explore the various applications of data science. 

[Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Building%20a%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier/P7.1%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier.ipynb) :  The objective of this project is to build a classification model to identify handwritten digits. I have used k-nearest neighbors algorithm and feed forward deep neural networks with different numbers of neurons and hidden layers for classifying handwritten digits. Coded in Python. 

[Building a Spam Filter Using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20Using%20Naive%20Bayes/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20Using%20Naive%20Bayes.ipynb) : In this project I have implemented the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm using python's pandas and numpy library to build a model to detect and categorize messages as spam or non - spam. 

[Predicting Stock Prices](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Stock%20Prices/Predicting%20the%20Stock%20Market.ipynb) : In this project I have built a Linear Regression model to predict stock proces using S&P 500 Index data from 1950 to 2015. I have also tried to perform next day predictions to see how performance of the model changes. Coded in Python.

[Predicting Loan Default Risk](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Loan%20Default%20Risk/Predicting%20Loan%20Default%20Risk.ipynb) :  The goal of this project is to explore LendingClub.com data and build a model to predict if a borrower will default or not. I built multiple models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest and compared the performance across different models. Coded using Python. 

[Analyzing Used E-Bay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Cleaning%20and%20Analyzing%20Ebay%20Used%20Car%20Sales%20Data/Ebay%20Used%20Car%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) : This project is an excersise in data cleaning and analysis. I wanted to practice my data cleaning chops and found this project as a great way to do that. I have cleaned the data and analysed the different factors affecting car prices. Coded using Python.

[Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Finding%20Bias%20in%20Fandango%20Ratings/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb) : 
In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a popular article where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest. In this project, I have analyzed more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. Coded using Python.

[Finding the Best Star Wars Movie](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Finding%20the%20Best%20Star%20Wars%20Movie/Star%20Wars%20Project.ipynb) : In this project, I will be working on the survey results published by FiveThrityEight asking people to vote for the best Star Wars movie.  I will be analysing the results of the survey and see what folks have to say. May the Force be with you!! Codes using Python.

[Analyzing Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20Hacker%20News%20Posts/%20Hacker%20News%20Posts%20Analysis.ipynb) : In this project I have explored submisisons to popular technology site Hacker News. Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. I will be analyzing the data to see which category of posts attract the most comments and if the time at which a post is submitted has anything to do with it.  

[Identifying Profitable App Store and Google Play Apps](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Identifying%20Profitable%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Apps/P1.1%20Apps%20Store%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) :  This is my first Python project!! Here I have explored Apps Store and Google Play data to determine app profiles that are likely to attract more users in both markets
