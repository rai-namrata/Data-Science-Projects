# Data Science Projects

This repository is a series of projects I have built as I continue to learn and explore the world of data science. 

[Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier](https://github.com/rai-namrata/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Building%20a%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier/P7.1%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier.ipynb) :  In this project, I tried to use and compare the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and neural networks with different numbers of neurons and different hidden layers for classifying handwritten digits problem.
